For over 15 years, I’ve been helping teams design and develop
scalable, cloud-based, event-driven API systems that handle
high-volume requests. My focus has always been on creating
user-friendly UIs, efficiency-driven APIs and workflows, and
applying DevOps best practices to improve deployment speed and
system reliability.

I’m passionate about mentoring and have guided engineers at all
levels, fostering a culture of continuous learning and growth.
I’ve helped boost productivity through pair programming, peer
reviews, and regular knowledge-sharing sessions—practices that
not only improve code quality but also strengthen team
collaboration.

I thrive in fast-paced, dynamic environments and am always eager
to learn. Exploring new technologies has consistently helped me
tackle complex technical challenges, leading to better
observability and maintainability in both local and deployed
environments.
