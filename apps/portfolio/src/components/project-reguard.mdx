As Chief Architect at Reguard, I led the transformation of an MVP warranty platform into a profitable business, achieving significant cost optimizations and establishing robust development practices.

## Motivation & Problem Statement

The initial platform, developed by external consultants, needed substantial optimization and scalability improvements. Our goal was to reduce operational costs while enhancing data processing capabilities and development efficiency.

## Technical Details & Architecture

### Backend Architecture

- Cloud Infrastructure: Deployed on Azure using AKS for container orchestration and Postgresql/TimescaleDB for data storage and metrics.
- Event Processing: Implemented Nats Jetstream for reliable inter-service communication and event processing.
- Workflow Management: Leveraged [Temporal.io](http://temporal.io/) and Argo Workflows for complex business process orchestration.
- ETL Pipeline: Designed and implemented a stage-gated process for merchant data ingestion.
- Metrics Aggregation: Built scalable workflows to optimize dashboard performance and reduce platform load.

### Frontend Development

- Admin Platform: Developed using NX.dev monorepo architecture and React.js.
- Reusable Components: Created shared component libraries in React and Golang.
- Cross-Platform Integration: Implemented seamless communication between frontend and backend using Nats Jetstream.

### Quality & Testing

- Test Coverage: Implemented mandatory code coverage requirements (80%+) for all new features.
- Quality Gates: Established automated quality checks in CI/CD pipeline using SonarQube.
- Code Review: Introduced pair programming sessions and thorough review processes.
- Documentation: Required comprehensive API documentation and architectural decision records.

### DevOps & Observability

- Continuous Deployment: Implemented ArgoCD for GitOps-based deployments.
- Monitoring Stack: Integrated Datadog and Sentry for comprehensive platform observability.
- On-Call System: Established standby rotation enabling engineers to maintain ownership of production features.

## Challenges & Key Contributions

- Team Building: Built and mentored a cross-functional engineering team, increasing productivity by 40%.  
- Process Implementation: Established effective team communication protocols and contribution guidelines.  
- Cost Optimization: Reduced operational costs by 60% through infrastructure and process improvements.  
- Component Architecture: Supported rapid development through reusable component libraries.  

## Impact & Outcome

- Transformed MVP into a profitable business ready for acquisition.  
- Achieved 60% reduction in operational costs.  
- Built and led a high-functioning engineering team.  
- Established robust development practices and monitoring systems.  

## Reflections

This project showcased the importance of building strong teams and establishing efficient processes. It demonstrated how technical leadership combined with mentorship can transform both a platform and the team supporting it. The experience reinforced my commitment to creating scalable solutions while nurturing engineering talent.
